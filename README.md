# Downloads
Visit the [Downloads](https://github.com/Effective-Quadratures/Effective-Quadratures/releases/tag/v4.0) section and get the latest release version. Development is very active right now, stay tuned for a new release in the second week of February 2017.

# Installation
For installation on Mac and Linux systems, simply type the following into the terminal. 
```bash
> sudo python setup.py install
```
For installation on Windows, you will need [Anaconda] (https://www.continuum.io/downloads#windows); select the Python 2.7 option. Upon successful installation, open the Sypder IDE and go into the Effective-Quadratures-master directory and type the following in the command window
```bash
> python setup.py install
```
This should build the code. Just make sure you include the location of effective_quadratures folder to your python file and you should be good to go.

# Testing
Effective-Quadratures uses [Travis](https://travis-ci.org/Effective-Quadratures/Effective-Quadratures) for testing. Our objective is to ensure that regardless of the platform used, the modules will provide the same numerical answer. For testing the suite of tools type
```bash
> python test.py
```
